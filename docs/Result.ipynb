    "- Both models achieved identical **test accuracy (51.39%)**, barely exceeding random chance.\n",
    "- **XGBoost** showed better generalization (AUC-ROC: 0.515 vs. 0.504) despite lower training accuracy.\n",

    "- **RF Focused on Streaks:** Price streak features (`streak_len_3/4/5`) dominated its top 5.\n",

    "##### **3. Limitations**\n",
